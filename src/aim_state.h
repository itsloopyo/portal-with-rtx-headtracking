// The bridge between the render-view detour and the crosshair detour.
// RenderView writes the head pose into the CViewSetup the frame is drawn from;
// the crosshair is painted later in the same frame and has no view of its own to
// read, so it needs both cameras: the one the game aims along and the one the
// frame is actually rendered with.
//
// It needs the ORIGINS as well as the angles. A rotation-only reticle can be
// placed from the angles alone, because a point and a direction project to the
// same pixel while the two eyes coincide. A 6DOF lean separates them - the frame
// is drawn from an eye up to 30cm away from the one the shot leaves - and from
// then on the reticle marks a point in the world, at a distance only a trace can
// give. See aim_point.cpp.
//
// Render-thread only, and deliberately unsynchronised: the HUD paint that
// consumes this happens in the same frame, on the same thread, as the RenderView
// call that publishes it. An atomic here would buy a fence on the hot path and
// nothing else.
