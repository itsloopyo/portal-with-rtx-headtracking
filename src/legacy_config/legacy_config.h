// The HeadTracking.ini reader of v0.1.0, the last build that read that file, frozen so a player
// updating from it is converted exactly as that build read it. Nothing in this folder is ever
// edited: tests/config_differential/ pins every file here by hash.
//
// Three things differ from the reader it was taken from (src/config.cpp at v0.1.0):
//   - it fills this frozen copy of that build's Config and its defaults, not the runtime type.
//     The defaults the old Config took from cameraunlock-core (PositionSettings, smoothing_utils.h)
//     are written out as the numbers they were, so a later core cannot move what an old file means;
//   - it writes nothing. A missing file reads as the defaults, which is what the old reader read
//     from the file it wrote there first, and Read reports it apart from a file it read;
//   - Config::FileLoggingRequested's separate read of [Debug] LogToFile joins it, as log_to_file.
