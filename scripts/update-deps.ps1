# Bump the vendored Ultimate ASI Loader under vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/.
# ============================================================================
# Usage:    pixi run update-deps
# Frequency: manual. The vendored copy is the install-time source of truth, so
# the dev runs this when they want a fresh upstream bump, reviews the diff and
# commits it. build / package / release never refresh, and neither does CI.
#
# Portal with RTX runs the 32-bit Source engine (hl2.exe), so the x86 asset
# (Ultimate-ASI-Loader.zip; the x64 build ships as Ultimate-ASI-Loader_x64.zip)
# is the right one. Upstream ships the loader inside a wrapper zip, but
# install.cmd consumes the raw dinput8.dll (copied to <game>\bin\winmm.dll:
# Source loads its modules from bin\ with an altered search path, so a proxy at
# the game root is never consulted). So the zip is staged in TEMP and only the
# DLL is vendored.
#
# The extracted DLL is NOT vendored as it comes: the x86 build embeds
# binkw32.dll (RAD Game Tools, proprietary), wndmode.dll (VEG / menopem, no
# licence) and vorbisfile.dll (Xiph.Org) as RCDATA resources, and the installer
# ZIP would redistribute all three. strip-loader-payload.ps1 zeroes them in the
# staged copy before it is hashed and vendored. Never skip that step.
