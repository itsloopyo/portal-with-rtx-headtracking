Prints the PE fingerprint of the installed Portal with RTX client.dll as a
paste-ready build-profile stub.

This is the first thing to run when a user reports the dormant log line
("no build profile matches this client.dll"), and the first step of a
rederive after a game patch. The mod routes on client.dll - not hl2.exe -
because that is the module CViewRender::RenderView lives in, and the only one
of the two that changes when the game code does.

The registry the stub feeds lives under src/builds/ (steam_offsets.cpp holds
every Steam profile, build_registry.* holds the lookup order).
